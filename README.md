# ToySocialNetwork ðŸ“±
Application with similar features to Facebook: <br>
1. creating an account,
2. sending friend requests with the possibility of accepting or rejecting them,
3. sending messages in private or group chat,
4. creating events or choosing to participate in some already existing ones,
5. updating profile, changing profile picture,
6. getting notification about friend request, messages and upcomin events.

Also, the graphical interface is user-friendly and looks similar to the interfaces of real social applications. <br>
The technology that I used is Java for backend and JavaFX for frontend. <br>
The application stores data about the user, friends and messages in a PostreSQL database. <br>
